      "An immersive Erasmus+ training in Moneasa focused on diversity, intercultural understanding, and anti-discrimination. A life-changing first project for many of our volunteers.",
    description: `🇷🇴✨ From May 12-21, our team had the opportunity to participate in the Peers for Diversity training course in Moneasa, Romania, hosted by our amazing partners <a href="https://instagram.com/ofensiva_tinerilor" target="_blank">@ofensiva_tinerilor</a>.

	🙌 For our volunteers, this was their first time joining an Erasmus+ project — and they all agreed:
	🗣 “It was one of the most unique and unforgettable experiences of our lives!”

	📚 During the training, they gained impactful knowledge and practical tools on diversity, intercultural understanding, and anti-discrimination — skills that will stay with them not only in their personal, but also in their professional journey.

	🌍 This project marked the closing chapter of our collaboration with Ofensiva Tinerilor on this project cycle — and we couldn’t be more proud of the growth, learning, and friendships built.`,
